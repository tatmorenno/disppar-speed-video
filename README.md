# DÃ­sppar Speed Video
Change video playback speed by pressing 'd' or 'r' key.

As I watch a lot of videos, I needed to create an extension for Google Chrome that allows me to quickly speed up or slow down a video I'm watching in Google Chrome by pressing the 'd' key (to make it 0.5x faster up to speed). maximum of 2x) or 'r' (make it 0.5x slower up to 0.5x).

You can donwload this repository and use in your chrome extensions.

(In development).
